# WinUiApp

**Highly WIP**

## A Simple Epic Games Launcher frontend using legendary made with WinUI


## Development

1. Download and Install Visual Studio 2022
    Make sure to include .NET Desktop Development and Windows App SDK C# Templates

    Or you can just run 

    `winget install "Visual Studio Community 2022"  --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop  Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.WindowsAppSDK.Cpp"  -s msstore`

2. Clone this repo

3. Download latest legendary [release](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/releases/download/0.20.33/legendary.exe) binary 
    into   `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\WinUIEGL\bin`

4. Follow legendary docs to initialise auth (this won't be necessary later)

5. Compile and run the app
